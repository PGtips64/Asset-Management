# 2214 Asset Management Group Assignment - Summary

[cite_start]This project executes a comprehensive analysis of active and passive investment strategies, structured across three interconnected modules: mutual fund performance evaluation, constrained mean-variance portfolio optimization, and an in-depth study of a renowned investor's strategy (Buffett's Alpha)[cite: 24, 57, 95].

##  Project Goals

| Module | Primary Goal | Data Utilized |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Performance Analysis (10 Funds)** | [cite_start]Evaluate the **alpha and value-added** (gross and net) of 10 active mutual funds against various benchmarks (CAPM, FF5, CPZ Index-Based), and characterize their factor exposures[cite: 24, 25, 36, 41, 45]. | [cite_start]Mutual fund returns, fees, AUM, CPI, FF 5-Factor returns[cite: 25, 26, 27]. |
| **2. Portfolio Choice (21 Assets)** | [cite_start]Construct and back-test **optimal portfolios** (Tangency and Minimum Variance) from a universe of 21 risky assets (10 active funds and 11 passive index funds) under practical investment constraints[cite: 57, 59, 67, 71]. | [cite_start]Returns for 10 active and 11 passive index funds, risk-free rate[cite: 58, 59]. |
| **3. Buffett's Alpha** | [cite_start]Determine the factor-adjusted performance (alpha) of **Berkshire Hathaway** and its public stock portfolio, and analyze the financial and factor characteristics of key acquisitions (Lubrizol, Heinz)[cite: 95, 96, 107]. | [cite_start]Berkshire returns, public stock portfolio returns, factor returns, Lubrizol/Heinz data[cite: 96]. |

##  Key Findings (Anticipated)

The analysis is expected to provide insights into modern investment practices and the active versus passive debate:

* [cite_start]**Fund Performance:** Performance measures, particularly **Net Value Added** (which accounts for fees, inflation-adjusted AUM, and alpha [cite: 47, 54][cite_start]), will identify which fund managers generated the most absolute wealth for their investors[cite: 51].
* [cite_start]**Factor Exposures:** Fund factor betas (FF5) will characterize the investment styles (e.g., size, value) of the funds, which will be used to logically **match the funds to their qualitative strategy descriptions** provided in the Appendix[cite: 36, 40, 119].
* [cite_start]**Optimal Portfolios:** The efficient frontier constructed under constraints (e.g., max 10% active weight, min 50% passive weight [cite: 67]) will demonstrate the trade-off between risk and return, validating the benefits of combining active management with low-cost passive vehicles.
* [cite_start]**Buffett's Alpha:** The results will compare the performance, volatility, and factor loadings of Berkshire Hathaway versus its public stock holdings, suggesting that total performance is derived from sources beyond public stock picking[cite: 102, 104]. [cite_start]Key acquisitions are expected to show value-oriented financial characteristics (e.g., high $\mathbf{B/M}$ or $\mathbf{E/P}$) consistent with fundamental analysis[cite: 108, 109, 116].
